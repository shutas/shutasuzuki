##### Top picks of cybersecurity learning resources

First and foremost, I want to put a disclaimer here that this post is strictly covering my top picks of resources I recommend for learning about *cybersecurity* topics. There is a good pool of resources not listed here which I use for other purposes (e.g. non-cybersecurity-related learning, certification preparation, etc.), but I'm not including them here. Without further ado, here is my list:

**Website** | **Comment**
-- | --
[Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/) | Advertised as the "world's largest hacking community," Hack The Box is a platform with tutorials, labs, challenges, Capture the Flags (CTFs), and much more. Sometimes it's hard to find, but try locating your regional Discord servers to connect with your local hacking enthusiasts.
[picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/) | picoCTF is an individual, jeopardy-style capture the flag website hosted by CyLab at Carnegie Mellon University. I highly recommend preparing Windows and Unix/Linux environments as some challenges are easier to crack in one environment over another. 
[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) | TryHackMe is a hands-on online training website where they give you a lesson with each exercise. Good for newbies who want to read up on concepts before they apply them in a training environment.

Youtube is also a treasure box filled with a wide range of cybersecurity content. Here are some of my favorites:

[NetworkChuck](https://www.youtube.com/c/NetworkChuck) | NetworkChuck channel has a strong focus on network infrastructure security, but it also has a good selection of videos that cover skills that are good to have as a "hacker".
[Jason Haddix](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Jason+Haddix) | Jason Haddix is an information security professional who actively shares his experiences in bug bounty. Jason doesn't have his own channel, but there are videos of him giving lectures at security conferences like DEFCON.

##### My thoughts on continuous learning

*Studying* is just not the same once you graduate from the school system and start working in the real world. After a long day at work, you're drained out of energy mentally and physically, and the only thing you want to do is take a break until the next working day. I get it. Most everyone feels this way.

But lack of motivation and energy just doesn't justify the omission of learning. The way I view learning is like your good old US index funds. You reap the benefits if you 1) start early; and 2) consistently contribute. Only then will you enjoy the magic of compound growth and great returns. You have to make a deliberate effort to learn something new, and repeat this every day (please don't play the "I already learn new things at work" card - you aren't really encountering new concepts as much as you might think. If you're not convinced, give it a try and jot down every new {cybersecurity} concept you learned today at work...). When you learn something new, you open an exponential number of possibilities to link your new concept with existing concepts and gain a deeper understanding of your knowledge base. The more concepts you already know, the more links you can potentially construct. Perhaps compound interest/growth is really the [8th Wonder of the World](https://www.inc.com/jim-schleckser/why-einstein-considered-compound-interest-most-powerful-force-in-universe.html).

Today is the youngest you'll ever be. Now is always the best time to start:)

Happy learning!
