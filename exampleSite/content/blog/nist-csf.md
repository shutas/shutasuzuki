##### Basic information about NIST CSF

This is the first post of our new series covering cybersecurity frameworks. Cybersecurity frameworks serve as reference documents which list the "should have's" in your IT environment, and they provide a logically structured base to start thinking about cybersecurity. Before we dive into the nitty-gritty details of NIST CSF, here are some of the basic information about this popular framework:

**Official Name** | **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF)**
-- | --
Published by | National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST; USA)
First Version | Version 1.0 (2014)
Latest Version | Version 1.1 (2018)
Targets | Critical Infrastructure (but can be used by businesses and organizations of any sector and size)
Key Characteristic | Generic description of cybersecurity requirements categorized in 5 functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

##### Background of NIST CSF

NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) was created in response to President Obama's Executive Order 13636 which directed NIST to create a voluntary framework to improve the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure. NIST CSF includes standards, guidelines, and best practices developed by the government and the industry.

##### Key points of NIST CSF

NIST CSF is comprised of 3 components: _Core_, _Implementation Tiers_, and _Profiles_.

The _Core_ consists of 5 major phases of securing infrastructure which NIST calls "functions": Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. These 5 functions are broken down into a total of 23 categories, and the 23 categories are broken down even further into 108 subcategories. Each of these subcategories are security controls to be implemented to manage and reduce cybersecurity risks.

The _Implementation Tiers_ are 4 defined levels of implementation maturity: Tier 1 (Partial), Tier 2 (Risk Informed), Tier 3 (Repeatable), and Tier 4 (Adoptable). These levels provide a guideline to quantify or quantitatively measure how much an organization has implemented each security controls listed in the _Core_. It is important to note here that an organization's goal isn't necessarily to achieve Tier 4 for all security controls, since the necessity to implement security controls depends on the underlying asset the organization is trying to protect.

The _Profiles_ are the conceptual states of an organization's cybersecurity maturity. Organizations should first create a "Current Profile" which reflects the current state of their cybersecurity activities. Next, they should create a "Target Profile" which describes the desired state to achieve. The goal of organizations then will be to close the gap between the "Current Profile" and the "Target Profile".

To sum up, NIST CSF essentially provides an end-to-end framework to perform a gap analysis of cybersecurity capabilities.
