##### Top picks of tools to boost efficiency

Good tools help you get to where you need faster. Efficiency is key to getting things done, and I have a few things I use daily to make sure I always make progress every single day. Here are my top picks:

**Tool** | **Comment**
-- | --
[Notion](https://www.notion.so/) | Let me just say that I use this for EVERYTHING. From taking notes to keeping track of my to-do's, this is my one-stop shop to get everything done. There are native Windows/Mac apps, but you can use their web app in case you are working in an atypical environment. Everything will be synced, so you can jump right back into the zone from anywhere. I've been using this quite extensively, but so far I've been able to get by their free personal plan and never had to pay a single penny.
[StudyWorks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClfss8GiZToQOdMREVllr_w) | StudyWorks is a YouTube channel where there are currently timer videos you can use when you're studying, working, or just getting things done. I like to use their timers that follow the [Pomodoro Technique](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique) as they help me concentrate by breaking up my work time into manageable chunks.
[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) | This tool probably needs no introduction for our developers out there, but Vim is a text editor commonly used in Unix systems. Notorious for being cryptic and *not* beginner-friendly, Vim is sometimes one of the few options you need to choose when you're working in an enviroment without a GUI. Vim is highly customizable, and if you take the time to learn the key strokes and shortcuts, it'll exponentially increase your productivity to edit any text-based files.

##### My thoughts on productivity tools

Productivity is often overlooked because many people believe that work output is primarily correlated to the inherent capabilities of individuals rather than the tools they use. There is an old Japanese proverb *["The master doesn't choose the brush"](https://landofnu.com/2014/06/09/kuukai-revisited/)* (弘法筆を選ばず) which tries to back this claim, essentially implying that the skilled individuals will display exceeding performance irrespective of what they use. I call that BS.

It's simply stubborn to assume that your "tools of the trade" have no significance in the output you produce. If you only give an [ENIAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC) to a computer programming prodigy and a modern Linux machine to a computer science university student, there is no way that that the prodigy will produce better programs than the student in a reasonable amount of time. Surely your tools matter, and it's also important that you can use the tool proficiently.

My tip with any activity is to stick to a good tool and know it well. Tools that boost productivity can be complex and have a high learning curve, but that's OK. Take your time to learn the tool one by one. Efforts you put in to learn the tool will be amortized, and eventually, you'll enjoy the true potential and advantages of the tools you've worked so hard to be proficient in.

Let me know if you have any favorite tools you use!
