##### Tips and tricks you should know to pass

* Book your exam **NOW**
>> After you make a reasonable study plan, you have to stick to the schedule. CISSP covers a wide range of topics, so you will have the opportunity to endlessly procrastinate if you can't commit on a date. The best way to stick to your plan is to book your exam so that you are limiting the amount of time you have left before taking your CISSP exam. Still unsure if you want to book your exam now? Maybe you unconsciously know that your plan isn't good enough.

* Think like a manager/CEO
>> You might have already heard this before elsewhere, but it's true. Cybersecurity is a __top-down__ activity, which means that your first and best bet to addressing any information security issue should come from senior management. If any answer choices offer an activity that your CEO or your Board of Directors can take action (like __"policy"__!), then most likely the best answer.

* Review the flow of testing at Pearson VUE professional testing center
>> If you have never taken an exam at a Pearson VUE professional testing center, take a moment to review the flow of the testing day. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlQr9Meee0I) is a sample video that matches exactly what I experienced on my test day.

** Does this change anything?
