##### Tips and tricks you should know to pass

> Book your exam **NOW**.
* This helps you stick to your plan and avoid procrastination.

> Think like a **manager/CEO**.
* Effective information security program must be top-down.

> Focus on **competency**, not knowledge.
* The CISSP exam determines whether you are a competent security professional, not a security bookworm.

> **Read only the question.** Predict the answer. Then read your answer choices.
* Answer choices can be tricky, because they may all sound like valid choices. Don't let them fool you.

> If you don't know the answer, make your bet and **move on**.
* Remember that 25 questions on your exam are prototype questions that are unscored.

> Review the flow of testing at Pearson VUE professional testing center
