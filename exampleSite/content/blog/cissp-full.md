##### Basic information about the CISSP exam

Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) is a professional certification offered by [(ISC)2](https://www.isc2.org/). It is considered as the __gold standard__ certification in the information security space. It tests you in 8 domains of information security that (ISC)2 has defined which they commonly refer to as the "Common Body of Knowledge (CBK)." You will need to take the test at one of [Pearson VUE's professional testing center](https://home.pearsonvue.com/) located across the globe.

For English test takers as of March 2022, the CISSP exam is a 3-hour long [computer adaptive test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yh60kwdvnlE) which mainly consists of multiple choice questions and potentially a few non-multiple choice questions such as drag-and-drop. It is an adaptive test which means two things: every test has a different set of questions and a different number of questions. As you go through the exam, the next question is determined based on whether or not you have correctly answered the current question. If you answer the current question correctly, the algorithm will challenge you with a slightly harder question in that domain. If you answer incorrectly, it will display you with a slightly easier one. This repeats until the algorithm deduces your competency level within their statistical confidence interval. A test taker may finish after a minimum of 100 questions, or may not finish until he/she reaches 150 questions. The test finishes as soon as the scoring algorithm decides your final result, so it's not necessarily the case that finishing the exam after exactly 100 questions means you passed. It's also good to note that there are 25 unscored questions which are scattered throughout the test. These are essentially new, prototype questions that they are testing out on real test takers. This rigourous process of creating test questions help maintain CISSP's quality and brand.

For non-English test takers, the exam is offered in select major languages. They are 6-hour long computer-based linear tests. They are not adaptive, and they have exactly 250 questions.

To pass the CISSP exam, you need to earn at least 700 out of 1000 on a scaled score. This doesn't really help much from a test taker's point of view, since you won't know which questions are worth how much during the exam. You also need to be above proficiency in all 8 domains, so you can't just completely neglect particular domains you aren't too familiar from your study.

##### What I did to prepare

Let me first state the background knowledge I had before starting the preparation for this exam. I have an undergraduate degree in computer science where I realized my hatred for computer programming. Fixing your own code, let alone other people's code, was a total nightmare. In my last year of college, I cut courses that required countless nights of battling buggy code with cans of Monster. Instead, I focused on taking more theoretical computer science courses. It's ironic that I ended up taking many computer science courses which do not use computers at all.

In addition to above, I took a few courses related to computer security along the way which introduced many concepts covered in the CBK. Nonetheless, this exam does not test detailed technical knowledge anyway, so the CISSP exam can be easily cracked without any previous exposure to information security as long as you are properly prepared.

Now on to the good stuff. Let me list everything I did to pass the CISSP exam.

As with any exam, the first step is research, research, and RESEARCH! Thousands of people before us have taken and passed the CISSP exam, so there is a plethora of CISSP exam specific information regarding preparation strategies, best study materials, mindsets, tips & tricks, etc. Obviously, you can study for the exam as long as you want and as deep as you want, but surely there are efficient ways to prepare and pass any exam. CISSP is no different. I began by reading through blog posts (like mine!) of those who passed the CISSP exam, researching books and training material they have used. Interestingly, you start to pick up some patterns, for example, that the official study guide written by (ISC)2 is not as good as you may think. (Fun fact: this is because within (ISC)2, those who write the official study guides and the actual exams are completely independent and do not share information - for very good reasons) You should also keep in mind what kind of student you are. I prefer to be presented with new material visually/orally since they tend to stick with me better. I'm also not a big reader, so I have a preference for shorter books. These characteristics helped me narrow the list of study materials and my overall study plan.

My initial exposure to CISSP material came from [Kelly Handerhan's CISSP course on Cybrary](https://www.cybrary.it/course/cissp/). Cybrary is an online learning platform dedicated to cybersecurity training, and I first heard about it during a conversation with my career coach from work who has also used the same course to pass his CISSP exam. I've also seen many great reviews online during my research phase, so I knew it would be a solid first step for a learner like me. Kelly's CISSP course is thorough and easy to digest. It consists of a series of video tutorials followed by practice exams at the end. This study material alone is probably not sufficient to pass the CISSP with high probability, but you'll be exposed to every concept you need to know for it.

After the online video course, I started reading through Eric Conrad's [Eleventh Hour CISSP: Study Guide](https://amzn.to/3E1opOn). My initial research has shown that that this book and Shon Harris's [CISSP All-in-One Exam Guide](https://amzn.to/3JHWd4t) covered content that was most relevant to the actual exam. However, the "Eleventh Hour CISSP: Study Guide" was much shorter in length (approximately 240 pages) compared to "CISSP All-in-One Exam Guide" (approximately 1360 pages), so I chose brevity over completeness. I'd rather perfect something short than be vaguely familiar with something long, so I think it was a fitting decision for me. Even this short book still included material not covered in the Cybrary course.

At this point, I had a fair understanding of what's covered in each domain, but I was also a little anxious to know if I knew enough to pass. I signed up for another CISSP training sponsored by my company which was offered by [Destination Certification](https://www.destcert.com/). Course instructors [John Berti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jberti/) and [Rob Witcher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robwitcher) are ex-Deloitte professionals who co-founded Destination Certification a few years back, and they provide specialized training for CISSP and CCSP exams. I took their 40-hour long masterclass and studied using their original test practice questions, leaving me with enough confidence to finally take the CISSP exam. Destination Certification has a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DestinationCertification) where they upload videos explaining tips and practice questions at no cost. They also offer free "MindMap" and domain review videos which are essentially a condensed version of the full masterclass.

The table below sums up the activities and efforts spent to prepare for the CISSP exam. Your time to completion may vary depending on your background and familiarity with the material.

**Activity** | **Time Spent** 
--- | --- 
Researching test preparation materials | 5 hours
[Kelly Handerhan's CISSP Videos (Cybrary)](https://www.cybrary.it/course/cissp/) | 40 hours
[Eleventh Hour CISSP: Study Guide (Eric Conrad)](https://amzn.to/3E1opOn) | 40 hours
[Destination Certification](https://www.destcert.com/) training | 60 hours

For a total of **145** hours.

I do want to point out here that as I was completing each of these activities, I spent my fair share of time reviewing and filling in knowledge gaps which I've included in the "**Time Spent**". For example, Kelly Handerhan's CISSP course on Cybrary is a little shy of 20 hours, but I rewatched certain videos a few times until I was able to digest the content and did further research on the Internet to solidify my understanding. Focus on learning the content, not finishing through the material as swiftly as possible.

##### My CISSP exam day

I registered for my very first CISSP exam attempt in March 2022, but I could feel all of my crammed knowledge leaking since the last day of Destination Certification's training, so I paid the extra $50 to reschedule it to an earlier date in February 2022. Living in New York City, my test center was a 15 minute train ride from my apartment, so I reviewed my study material until the very last minute and headed straight to the testing site. 

As soon as I arrived at the testing site, I was asked to go to the restroom to wash my hands. It was a COVID-19 prevention protocol at my particular testing center. With my cleaned hands, I handed my verification documents to the lady at the desk who later took my headshot and scanned my palm veins. I was instructed to put away all of my personal belongings into a locker which filled one of the walls of the waiting room as she handed me a double-sided document with testing instructions written in tiny letters. It took a lot of concentration to read through these instructions knowing that my CISSP exam was about to start in a few minutes. 

After reading through the instructions, I let the lady know, and she instructed me to start walking down the hallway which led to the testing room. The exam proctor reviewed my documents, verified my palm veins, and inspected my glasses for any hidden cameras. I was let in the testing room.

The exam proctor walked me to my seat and configured the computer to start my CISSP exam. I put on a noise-cancelling headphone they provided which was tight but light. I took a deep breath. I began my exam.

Something's not right.

I started going through the first few questions, and I felt like I'm taking the wrong exam. I saw questions that talked about things I'd never heard of. I glanced at the top of my screen to make sure that I'm taking the CISSP exam. Yes, I was. I went through a few more questions, and I glanced back at the top of the screen again, but I was still taking the CISSP exam. I kept answering the questions presented in front of me. The questions felt foreign, but I had spent a lot of time and effort preparing for this moment. I gave my best shot.

My test ended right after question 125 with a little shy of 1 hour remaining. I knew I failed.

One you finish your test, your proctor will print out a letter with your exam results on your way out. Rumor has it that if you fail, the letter will contain an ordered list of domains sorted by your weakest areas. Instead my letter started with an enthusiatic "Congratulations!" which made me second look the letter to make sure it was mine. I confirmed my name on the letter, but it still didn't sink in. It was until the day after when it hit me that my journey was over.

I still can't believe I have this document with me. It's one big achievement.

##### Tips, tricks, and thoughts you should know to pass

Before I share some neat tips and tricks, if you have finalized your study plan, **BOOK YOUR EXAM NOW.** You won't stick to your plan if you make the exam date flexible. Once you book the exam, declare it to everyone around you so that you are held accountable. Are you afraid that you won't pass the exam and be humiliated by everyone who you told that you'll be taking the exam? Maybe that's an indication that your study plan isn't good enough.

Let's now look at some useful things to keep in mind throughout your journey to earn your CISSP certification.

> **Pro-tip:** CISSP is a __managerial__ exam.

If you've done your research, you probably have already encountered this point. As many people say, "For the CISSP exam, think like a manager/CEO!" It's true - the CISSP is a __managerial__ exam, not a techical one. Don't be fooled by some answer choices which sound so correct because they offer a concrete, techincal solution. Cybersecurity has to be a **top-down** activity, which means that the very first step in addressing any security risk has to come from senior management. If "policy" is an answer choice, it's most likely the correct answer.

> **Pro-tip:** CISSP measures __competency__, not knowledge.

As the name implies, CISSP is a __professional__ exam. What this means is that the exam is not meant to test your ability to memorize the smallest technical details, but rather your __competency__ to make the best decisions as a security professional. This mindset is important to keep in mind since we (technical professionals like me and you!) tend to focus on the technical aspects of secure technology. 

Yes, you still need to memorize new concepts and details to a certain degree. You can't make a good security decision without baseline knowledge and understanding. But it's most likely not a good use of your time to memorize the list of standard attributes on an X.509 certificate, but you should be prepared to answer what you might do with X.509 certificates if your organization's private key has been compromised (e.g. have your certificate be listed on your certificate authority's certificate revocation list? Or even better... check your organization's policy!). Always remember to take a step back and think about how the material you are currently studying fit into the overall vision of information security.

> **Pro-tip:** Don't let your answer choices choose you. **You choose them.**

There will be many questions on the exam where you're given multiple "good" answer choices and one "best" answer choice. The CISSP exam is testing your competency to choose the "best" one, but this becomes exponentially more difficult if you passively read through your choices instead of actively searching for the best choice.

This takes practice, but it can be done. Make it a habit to read __only the question__ first, and focus on collecting the "key" words/phrases in the question that defines it unique. Are we looking for something that guarantees "authenticity" or "integrity"? Is the service "internal" or "external"? "Who" is trying to protect "what"? You might need to read through the question a few times identify key terms and internalize what the question is asking.

Once you know what the question is asking for, make a prediction for the answer. Only then should you go ahead and read your given answer choices to see if any of them match what you had in mind. This method helps you avoid picking an answer choice that looks appealing because it looks good, but maybe not good enough.

<hr>

> **Pro-tip:** If you don't know the answer, give your best shot and **move on**.

CISSP covers such a wide range of topics that no one will ever be able to completely cover them in detail. Accordingly, you will encounter questions that ask you something you may have no idea about. BUT THAT'S OKAY. Make your best educated guess, and move on.

Since the CISSP exam is an adaptive test (at least for those who are taking the exam in English), many exam takers spend more than necessary amount of time when they come across a question for which they are not sure of the answer, let alone a question that introduces something they have never heard of before. Because they cannot skip and return to the question later in the exam, they try to spend time to think and see if they can come up with an answer with a creative justification. Don't be that person! Remember that your exam will contain 25 prototype questions (that's 25% of your entire exam if you finish it right at 100 questions!) that are left unscored. It's very likely that the question you're stuck on is one of them. Just make your best educated guess, and shift your focus onto the next question.

Also as an end note, if you have never taken a test with Pearson VUE at their profesional testing centers (like me), then you should review [what to expect on your test day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlQr9Meee0I).
