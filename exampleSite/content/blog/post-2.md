##### Basic information about the CISSP exam

Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) is a professional certification offered by (ISC)2. It is considered as the __gold standard__ certification in the information security space. It tests you in 8 domains of information security that (ISC)2 has defined which they commonly refer to as the Common Body of Knowledge (CBK). You will need to take the test at one of Pearson VUE's professional testing center located across the globe.

For English test takers as of March 2022, the CISSP exam is a 3-hour long [computer adaptive test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yh60kwdvnlE) which mainly consists of multiple choice questions and potentially a few non-multiple choice questions such as drag-and-drop. It is an adaptive test which means two things: every test has a different set of questions and a different number of questions. As you go through the exam, the next question is determined based on whether or not you have correctly answered the current question. If you answer the current question correctly, the algorithm will challenge you with a slightly harder question in that domain. If you answer incorrectly, it will display you with a slightly easier one. This repeats until the algorithm deduces your competency level within their statistical confidence interval. A test taker may finish after a minimum of 100 questions, or may not finish until he/she reaches 150 questions. The test finishes as soon as the scoring algorithm decides your final result, so it does not necessarily mean that finishing the exam after exactly 100 questions means that you passed. It's also good to note that there are 25 unscored questions which are introduced into the test as protype questions.

For non-English test takers, the exam is offered in select major languages. They are 6-hour long computer-based linear tests. They are not adaptive, and they have exactly 250 questions.

To pass the CISSP exam, you need to earn at least 700 out of 1000 on a scaled score. This doesn't really help much from a test taker's point of view, since you won't know which questions are worth how much during the exam. You also need to be above proficiency in all 8 domains, so you can't just completely neglect particular domains you aren't too familiar from your study.

##### What I did to prepare

Let me first state the background knowledge I had before starting the preparation for this exam. I have an undergraduate degree in computer science where I realized my hatred for computer programming. Fixing your own code, let alone other people's code, was a total nightmare. In my last year of college, I cut courses that required countless nights of battling with buggy code and cans of Monster drinks. Instead, I focused on taking more theoretical computer science courses. My last semester of college was devoted to drafting proofs by reduction to mathematically show the security guarantees of various cryptosystems. I ended up taking many computer science courses which do not use computers at all.

In addition to above, I took a few courses related to computer security along the way which introduced many concepts covered in the CBK. Nonetheless, this exam does not test detailed technical knowledge anyway, so the CISSP exam can be easily cracked without any previous exposure to information security as long as you are properly prepared.

Now on to the good stuff. Let me list everything I did to pass the CISSP exam.

As with any exam, the first step is research, research, and RESEARCH! Thousands of people before us have taken and passed the CISSP exam, so there are a ton of CISSP exam specific information regarding preparation strategies, best study materials, mindsets, tips & tricks, etc. Obviously, you can study for the exam as long as you want and as deep as you want, but surely there are efficient ways to prepare and pass any exam. CISSP is no different. I began by reading through blog posts (like mine!) of those who passed the CISSP exam, researching books and training material they have used. Interestingly, you start to pick up some patterns, for example, that the official study guide written by (ISC)2 is not as good as you may think. (Fun fact: this is because within (ISC)2, those who write the official study guides and the actual exams are completely independent and do not share information - for very good reasons) You should also keep in mind what kind of student you are. I'm not a big reader, so I have a preference for shorter books. Instead, I prefer to be presented with new material visually since they tend to stick with me better. Upon few hours of research, I've narrowed the list of study materials to use until the exam.

The table below sums up the activities and efforts spent to prepare for the CISSP exam. Your time to completion may vary depending on your background.

**Activity** | **Time Spent** 
--- | --- 
Researching test preparation materials | 5 hours
Kelly Handerhan's CISSP Videos | 20 hours
Eleventh Hour | 20 hours
Destination Certification training | 60 hours

For a total of **105** hours.

##### My CISSP exam day

I registered for my very first CISSP exam attempt in March 2022, but I could feel all of my crammed knowledge leaking since the last day of Destination Certification's training, so I paid the extra $50 to reschedule it to an earlier date in February 2022. Living in New York City, my test center was a 15 minute train ride from my apartment, so I reviewed my study material until the very last minute and headed straight to the testing site. 

As soon as I arrived at the testing site, I was asked to go to the restroom to wash my hands. It was a COVID-19 prevention protocol at my particular testing center. With my cleaned hands, I handed my verification documents to the lady at the desk who later took my headshot and scanned my palm veins. I was instructed to put away all of my personal belongings into a locker which filled one of the walls of the waiting room as she handed me a double-sided document with testing instructions written in tiny letters. It took a lot of concentration to read through these instructions knowing that my CISSP exam was about to start in a few minutes. 

After reading through the instructions, I let the lady know, and she instructed me to start walking down the hallway which led to the testing room. The exam proctor reviewed my documents, verified my palm veins, and inspected my glasses for any hidden cameras. I was let in the testing room.

The exam proctor walked me to my seat and configured the computer to start my CISSP exam. I put on a noise-cancelling headphone they provided which was tight but light. I took a deep breath. I begin my exam.

Something's not right.

I start going through the first few questions, and I feel like I'm taking the wrong exam. I see questions that talk about things I've never heard of. I glance at the top of my screen to make sure that I'm taking the CISSP exam. Yes, I am. I go through a few more questions, and I glance back at the top of the screen again, but I'm still taking the CISSP exam. I keep answering the questions presented in front of me. The questions felt foreign, but I've spent a lot of time and effort preparing for this moment. I gave my best shot.

My test ended right after question 125 with a little shy of 1 hour remaining. I knew I failed.

One you finish your test, your proctor will print out a letter with your exam results on your way out. Rumor has it that if you fail, the letter will contain an ordered list of domains sorted by your weakest areas. Instead my letter started with an enthusiatic "Congratulations!" which made me second look the letter to make sure it was mine. I confirmed my name on the letter, but it still didn't sink in. It was until the day after when I realized that my journey is over.

I still can't believe I have this document with me. It's one big achievement.

##### Tips, tricks, and thoughts you should know to pass

Before I share some neat tips and tricks, if you have decided your study plan, **BOOK YOUR EXAM NOW.** You won't stick to your plan if you make the exam date flexible. Once you book the exam, declare it to everyone around you so that you are held accountable. Afraid that you won't pass the exam and be humiliated by everyone who you told that you will be taking the exam? Maybe that's a good indication that your study plan isn't good enough.

Let's now look at some useful things to keep in mind throughout your journey to earn your CISSP certification.

> **Pro-tip:** CISSP is a __managerial__ exam.

If you've done your research, you probably have already encountered this point. As many people say, "For the CISSP exam, think like a manager/CEO!" It's true - the CISSP is a __manegerial__ exam, not a techical one. Don't be fooled by some answer choices which sound so correct because they offer a concrete, techincal solution. Cybersecurity has to be a **top-down** activity, which means that the very first step in addressing any security risk has to come from senior management. If "policy" is an answer choice, it's most likely the correct answer.

> **Pro-tip:** CISSP measures __competency__.
